## Linked Menus

This is a React application that displays a simple menu of up to 6 buttons. Clicking 1 of the 6 buttons in the menu will either
display a new nested menu or a form for submission, which sends data to a server endpoint.
Some of the menu buttons perform no function and in that case they display a message to indicate that they have not yet been
implemented.

Once you either clone the project or download the zip file, go inside the folder (`Linked_Menus`) and run `npm install` in the cmd. 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:8080/] to view it in the browser.

### `npm run test`

Runs the test.
