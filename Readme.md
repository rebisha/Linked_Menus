## Colors

This is a React application that displays a simple menu of up to 6 buttons. Clicking 1 of the 6 buttons in the menu will either
display a new nested menu or a form for submission, which sends data to a server endpoint.
Some of the menu buttons perform no function and in that case they display a message to indicate that they have not yet been
implemented.

In order to run the project, run `npm install` in the cmd. After its completion run `npm start` to actually start the project.

### `npm start`
